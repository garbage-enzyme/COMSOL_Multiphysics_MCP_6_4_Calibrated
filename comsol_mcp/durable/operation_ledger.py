"""Durable, replayable operation ledger for Model Manager and owner events.

Why a separate ledger
---------------------

The operation modules decide *whether* something may happen and *what* a receipt
must say. This module makes those receipts durable and replayable, so a crash,
a restart, a lost transport, or a delayed file share can be diagnosed from
evidence instead of from memory.

It is append-only by construction. An operation is journaled once, and the
journal is the authority for what happened; the in-memory index exists only to
answer questions quickly and is rebuilt entirely from the journal on load. That
makes a restart replay exactly what was recorded rather than what the previous
process believed.

Frozen rules
------------

* **One row per attempt, written before the outcome is reported.** A crash after
  the write leaves a durable record of the attempt; a crash before it leaves no
  claim at all. There is no path where an operation is reported without a row.
* **Replay is the recovery mechanism.** A restart reconstructs state from the
  journal, so an operation that was already accepted is never performed twice.
* **Accepted artifacts are never overwritten.** A second attempt to accept the
  same artifact identity with different bytes is refused; the original stands.
* **Uncertainty survives the round trip.** An unresolved identity or an
  unverified cleanup state replays as ``unknown``, never promoted to a success.
* **The ledger cannot be silently truncated.** A partial trailing row is
  reported and excluded rather than treated as authoritative, and a corrupt
  journal is refused rather than partially trusted.
