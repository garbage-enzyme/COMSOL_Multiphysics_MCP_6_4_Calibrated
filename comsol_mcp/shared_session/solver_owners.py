"""Bounded parallel solver-owner registry for shared local sessions.

Why this exists
---------------

The shared-session plan permits at most two independent COMSOL solver owners to
run in parallel, each fixed to one core, so a caller can view and work on
multiple models without serializing everything. It also forbids three things
that a naive "just allow another client" implementation would permit: a third
owner, multi-core solver use, and cross-owner model access.

This module is the admission authority for those three rules. It is a pure
registry: it holds no process handles, starts nothing, and terminates nothing.
That separation is deliberate — a policy decision must be testable without a
solver, and a bug in admission must not be able to kill someone else's process.

Frozen rules
------------

* **At most two owners**, and each occupies exactly one core. A request for two
  cores is refused rather than silently reduced, because silently reducing a
  caller's declared resource policy would misrepresent what was run.
* **One core per owner is the ceiling, not a default.** The registry has no
  multi-core mode.
* **No cross-owner access.** A model, task, or job owned by one owner is
  invisible to another; the refusal is indistinguishable from "not found" so the
  registry cannot be used to enumerate another owner's work.
* **Admission is per owner, not per request.** A registered owner holds its slot
  until it is explicitly released with a verified release, so a client cannot
  multiply its concurrency by opening more sessions.
* **Verdicts are pure.** Nothing here observes the machine; the caller supplies
  the facts, and the registry states the decision and its reason.
